# FINAL ASSIGNMENT


I want you to use data as a material or a starting point to create an artwork. The data you use should be something of interest to _you_.  You can synthesize this data in any way you'd like with sculpture, code, drawing, weaving, sound, food. Etc. 

The only rules are that **you must document your process of transforming the data. This documentation doesn't have to be part of the artwork itself. It can be written or a supplemental diagram.**

So for example, here the artist clearly documents how she converts the information into numbers and then colors in these notes...




**You can use whatever data you like. You can use data you found in the library, or online, but you need to send me the data to be approved first. If you are collecting your own data, you need to record it in a .csv file and send it to me as well.**


## I've also found some sample datasets that you are welcome to use...


### [Hangzhou Bus Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AaratiAkkapeddi/CAA/master/Assignments/FINAL_ASSIGNMENT/SAMPLE_DATA/Hangzhou%20Bus%20Data/bus_data.js)

### [Hangzhou Bike Share Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AaratiAkkapeddi/CAA/master/Assignments/FINAL_ASSIGNMENT/SAMPLE_DATA/Hangzhou_bike_share_data/bike_share_data.js)

How to read the data:
1. Time range: 20130809-20131113.
2. Number of clusters of stations in Hangzhou: 40.
3. Each column represents the flows between two clusters, e.g., Column “0403” records the time series of flows between Cluster 04 and Cluster 03.
4. Each row represents an instance of all the flows at a certain time period, e.g., Row “20130909 11” is an instance of the flows among all the cluster pairs between 20130909 11:00:00 - 20130909 11:59:59.
